# Site crawler example
A JS site crawler example. I wrote this code to crawl a specific website and submit some of its data to my own server.

## Considerations
1. The JS is pasted in the developer tab's console while on the page I want crawled - it's a manual process and not hosted on a server
2. The code is very specific to the site I wanted to crawl - it won't work on any other site without some degree of modification.
