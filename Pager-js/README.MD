# Page ticker bookmarklet
This little piece of javascript is useful if you have to frequently navigate a website that uses querystrings with ID's to fetch content.

Example myblog.com/page?pageId=1

The bookmarklet lets you page to the next page by incrementing the numberic ID found in the querystring.

1. To use, create a new bookmark in your browser, and instead of adding a link, add the code in the JS file (without the comments). 
2. Simply click the bookmark to increment the ID.
3. You can make two bookmarklets, one for incrementing and one for decrementing. Just change the value of the "change" variable.
